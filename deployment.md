# Deployment Guide for GatherEase

This guide provides instructions for deploying the GatherEase application to production environments.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- MongoDB database (Atlas recommended for production)
- Clerk account for authentication
- (Optional) Stripe account for payments

## Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template
2. Update all environment variables with your production values:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your MongoDB connection string
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`: Your Clerk API keys
   - Other environment variables as needed

## Build Process

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the application
pnpm build

# Start the production server
pnpm start
```

## Deployment Options

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy using the Vercel dashboard or CLI

```bash
# Using Vercel CLI
vercel --prod
```

### Docker Deployment

A Dockerfile is provided for containerized deployment:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t gatherease .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env gatherease
```

### Traditional Hosting

1. Build the application as described above
2. Transfer the built files to your hosting environment
3. Set up a process manager like PM2:

```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start the application
pm2 start npm --name "gatherease" -- start

# Ensure PM2 restarts on system reboot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

## Database Considerations

- Ensure your MongoDB instance has proper security measures
- Set up database backups
- Consider using MongoDB Atlas for managed database services

## Monitoring and Logging

- Set up application monitoring using services like Sentry or New Relic
- Configure proper logging for production
- Set up alerts for critical errors

## Security Considerations

- Ensure all API keys and secrets are properly secured
- Set up proper CORS configuration
- Enable HTTPS for all traffic
- Regularly update dependencies

## Performance Optimization

- Enable caching where appropriate
- Use a CDN for static assets
- Optimize images and assets
- Configure proper HTTP caching headers

## Scaling

- Consider using a load balancer for horizontal scaling
- Implement database connection pooling
- Use Redis for session storage and caching in high-traffic scenarios

## Maintenance

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Perform regular backups

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Check application logs
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure database connection is working
4. Check for network/firewall issues
5. Verify Clerk authentication is properly configured
